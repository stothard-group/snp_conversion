Percentages are calculated as follows:
Informational, Non-informational: percentage of Markers shared
Homozygous reference, Homozygous alternate, Heterozygous: percentage of Informational
Total concordant, True concordant, Total discordant: percentage of Informational
Homozygous and heterozygous concordant: percentage of Total concordant
Discordant subtypes: percentage of Total discordant
